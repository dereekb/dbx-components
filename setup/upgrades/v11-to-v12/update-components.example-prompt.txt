Take a look at @update-components-example.ts to understand how to update Angular 16 components to Angular 18 components. You will be working with a developer to save time making updates to modernize components.

The updates follow the following rules:
- directives and components should be marked as standalone
- @Components should now declare imports: []. You can guess the imports but PLEASE DO NOT FIXING IMPORTS IF AN ERROR APPEARS. The developer will fix imports.
- NgIf, NgSwitch, and NgSwitchCase should not be imported since they are being replaced with new Angular control flow syntax @if, @switch, and @case.
- If you notice there are some import errors in the component file, DO NOT FIX THEM. Ignore them and wait for developer input first.
- since we are using signals, add changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush to the @Component configuration
- BehaviorSubjects should only be converted to signals if they were only used in the template using the `async` pipe and value set via @Input()
- signal variables should be declared as private readonly with an underscore prefix and the Signal suffix. e.g. `private readonly _internalSignal = signal<number>(0);`
- signal variable names have the Signal suffix. e.g. readonly internalSignal = this._internalSignal.asReadonly();
- signals created via toSignal() or computed() can be made public directly.
- signals created via toSignal() or computed() should always have the Signal suffix. e.g. `readonly presetAnchors = toSignal(this.presetAnchors$);`
- public signals of private signals should be exposed using the private signal's .asReadonly() method. e.g. `readonly internalSignal = this._internalSignal.asReadonly();`. This does not apply to signals created via toSignal(...) as they are already readonly.
- public signals that are computed from private signals should use computed(). e.g. `readonly internalSignal = computed(() => !this._internalSignal());`
- input signals should not have the Signal suffix. e.g. `readonly block = input<Maybe<boolean>>();`
- input signals should typically use Maybe<...> if the @Input being replaced is optional. e.g. `readonly block = input<Maybe<boolean>>();` that replaces `@Input() block?: boolean;`
- if removing all BehaviorSubjects or all destroyable variables that are destroyed in ngOnDestroy, then remove the ngOnDestroy method and update the class declaration to no longer implement OnDestroy.
- All usage of the async pipe should be replaced with signals usage. e.g. `{{ block() }}` instead of `{{ block$ | async }}`
- Any @Output should be updated to use output() in instead. e.g. `@Output() block: EventEmitter<Maybe<boolean>> = new EventEmitter<Maybe<boolean>>();` is replaced by `readonly block = output<Maybe<boolean>>();`
- EventEmitters no longer need to be destroyed
- If an EventEmitter was destroyed in ngOnDestroy, then remove the destroy call
- If ngOnDestroy is now empty it can also be removed, along with implements OnDestroy.
- Do not add additional comments, but you can move or modify existing comments.
